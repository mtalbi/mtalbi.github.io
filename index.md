I'm Mehdi Talbi. I'm a security researcher. My main interests are exploit
development, reverse engineering and intrusion detection.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science. During my academic research, I worked mainly
on the formal verification of cryptographic protocols.

In 2012, I joined [Stormshield](www.stormshield.com) where I contributed to the
[Haka open source project](haka-security.org).

I have presented my research at several conferences including Infiltrate,
Warcon, Virus Buleltin, Defcon, Blackhat, etc.

Here, you can find some of my [posts](/posts) and a list of my
[publications](/papers).

I enjoy travelling around the world. I like Guy Ritchie's movies and appreciate
Dark Tranquillity's Music.
